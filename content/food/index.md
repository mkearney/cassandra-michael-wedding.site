If you are looking to stroll for dessert, Sparky’s is a 2-minute walk from the Tiger Hotel to a “Cozy shop serving housemade ice cream in a casual space with eclectic art on the walls.” Mike highly recommends the cinnamon ice cream, Casi prefers a classic chocolate!

If you want to get a little local coffee, we love Kaldi’s. It’s a 2-minute walk from the Tiger Hotel and they are a “chill coffeehouse specializing in coffee & espresso drinks made from carefully sourced beans.” Highly recommend the vanilla latte!
